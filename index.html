     <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
     <h4><a href="https://tinyurl.com/MultilinkArm-Dimensionality " style="color: #fefbd8" >UCSB Dynamic Robotics Lab:<br>Multilink Arm / Dimensionality Research Project</a></h4>     
     <h4><p>Roman was an AI Robotics Researcher at the UCSB Dynamic Robotics Laboratory for 5 years, where he investigated fundamental AI algorithm performance on robot control tasks. He created custom simulation environments of highly redundant N-link robot arms using Open AI’s Gym API in order to evaluate control algorithm performance as it was affected by (i) the number parts on a robot, (ii) the complexity of a robot’s environment, and (iii) the complexity of a robot’s task. He ultimately discovered evidence to suggest that the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm learns motions rather than making sense of end goal points. His work and contributions were awarded the Google-CAHSI Dissertation Fellowship in 2023.</p></h4>

     <h4><p>Roman has also worked as a Field Data Science Intern at TRIC Robotics where he contributed to an existing vision system and automated the collection of plant data. He modified the electrical wiring of their vision system in order to mount it onto TRIC’s Luna Robot. He also automated the implementation of image recognition algorithms to detect center points of strawberry plants and record the GPS position of plant center points during plant treatment.</p></h4>

     <h4><p>Roman was an Embedded Systems Researcher at the UCSD Neural Interaction Laboratory for 2 years. He worked with the Programmable-System-on-Chip 4 BLE, leveraging the onboard modules such as the analog-to-digital converter, operational amplifier, and Bluetooth-Low-Energy transmitter to create a prototype device that transmits epidermal sensor information to a smartphone application and computer. He programmed the microcontroller in C, wired the electrical components, and also redesigned the electrical circuits. His work contributed to a larger project that was published in Advanced Materials 2017.</p></h4>
